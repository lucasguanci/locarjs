# Testing LocAR.js

Using LocAR.js to develop a location-based web-app running both on iOS and Android.


I started from LocAR.js Tutorial - Part 2 that has been modified to enable device orientation on iOS (see btnStart) and to make use of webkit absoluteDeviceOrientationControl, see AR-js-org/AR.js#466 and also https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/1ee2fca970e3afdc26e6c2a47c14e9e2b784ae48/examples/jsm/controls/DeviceOrientationControls.js

The model displays an animated flag imported as a glb file.

A demo version is available at https://www.idrovolante.org/demo/AR
