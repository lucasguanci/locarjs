# Testing LocAR.js

Using LocAR.js to develop a location-based web-app running both on iOS and Android.

I started form [LocAR.js Tutorial - Part 2](https://github.com/AR-js-org/locar.js/blob/master/docs/tutorial/part2.md) that has been modified to enable device orientation on iOS (see btnStart) and to make use of webkit absoluteDeviceOrientationControl, see https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/issues/466 and also https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/1ee2fca970e3afdc26e6c2a47c14e9e2b784ae48/examples/jsm/controls/DeviceOrientationControls.js
